# Ingress & Egress Traffic Security Analysis

This document provides a step-by-step breakdown of the security layers for a typical request made to `https://n8n.yourdomain.com` in this stack.

## Ingress Traffic (User to n8n)

Ingress traffic flows from the public internet to the n8n service.

1.  **User's Browser → Cloudflare Network**
    *   **Protocol:** HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3)
    *   **Security:** **Fully Encrypted.** Cloudflare provides a valid, publicly trusted SSL certificate. This protects against eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on the public internet. Your Cloudflare WAF and DDoS protection are also active here.

2.  **Cloudflare Network → `cloudflared` Container**
    *   **Protocol:** Cloudflare Tunnel (Argo Tunnel)
    *   **Security:** **Fully Encrypted.** This is a secure tunnel initiated from your `cloudflared` container to Cloudflare's edge. Because it's an outbound-only connection, you do not need to open any inbound ports on your server's firewall, which significantly reduces your external attack surface.

3.  **`cloudflared` Container → `traefik` Container**
    *   **Protocol:** HTTP
    *   **Security:** **Unencrypted.** The `cloudflared` container decrypts the traffic and forwards it as a plain HTTP request to the Traefik entrypoint (`:8082`).
    *   **Risk Level:** Low. This traffic is isolated within the `n8n-net` Docker bridge network. An attacker would already need to have compromised your host or another container within that specific network to intercept it.

4.  **`traefik` Container → `n8n` Container**
    *   **Protocol:** HTTP
    *   **Security:** **Unencrypted.** Traefik processes the request and forwards it to the final `n8n` service (`:5678`) over the same internal Docker network.
    *   **Risk Level:** Low, for the same reason as the previous step. This is a standard and generally accepted practice in containerized environments.

## Egress Traffic (n8n back to User)

Egress traffic is the response flowing from the n8n service back to the user. The return path is the exact reverse of the ingress path, with the same security characteristics at each hop:

*   **n8n → Traefik:** Unencrypted (Internal Docker Network)
*   **Traefik → cloudflared:** Unencrypted (Internal Docker Network)
*   **cloudflared → Cloudflare Network:** Fully Encrypted (Cloudflare Tunnel)
*   **Cloudflare Network → User's Browser:** Fully Encrypted (HTTPS)

## Summary

Your traffic is secure from the public internet until it enters your internal Docker network. The lack of encryption inside your Docker network is a standard architectural pattern, and the risk is generally considered low and acceptable due to the network isolation provided by Docker.
