# Changelog

This file documents the changes made to the original project from the [tutorial by Kjetil Furas](https://kjetilfuras.com/self-host-n8n-with-cloudflare-zero-trust/).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

-   **Traefik Hardening**: Switched from Docker/Podman socket to a file-based provider (`./traefik/dynamic_conf.yml`) to reduce attack surface and enhance security by preventing direct access to the container daemon.

### Added

-   **Security Policy (`SECURITY.md`)**: Added a formal security policy with instructions for reporting vulnerabilities.
-   **Traffic Security Analysis (`docs/traffic-security-analysis.md`)**: New documentation detailing the data flow and security measures at each layer of the stack.

### Changed

-   **Pinned Image Versions**: Pinned the `n8n` image to the `stable` tag and `traefik` to `v3.5` for more stable and predictable deployments.
-   **Synchronized Compose Files**: Updated `podman-compose.yml` to align with the latest improvements in `docker-compose.yml`.
-   **Podman Documentation**: Overhauled `docs/podman-setup.md` to reflect the new file-based configuration for Traefik.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-13
